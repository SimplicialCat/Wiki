> If you (like many people working in homotopy theory and/or higher category theory and/or homotopy type theory) think that **spaces are the real fundamental objects and sets are just the reflective subcategories of $0$-truncated space**, then the role usually played by $\mathbb{Z}$ in traditional set-based mathematics is now played by $\mathbb S$, and $\mathbb Z$ only appear as the $0$-truncation of $\mathbb S$.
