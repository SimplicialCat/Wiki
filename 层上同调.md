> For many sheaves that appear in practice, the topological space $X(U)$ assigned to any test space $U$ is not just a topological space, but happens to have the structure of an **abelian group**, too. In this case a cascade of simplifications kicks in: first of all, such topological spaces, by a special case of something called the **homotopy hypothesis** (which is now really a precise theorem) can be identified with simplicial abelian groups. Second, by another theorem called the **Dold–Kan correspondence**, simplicial abelian groups are equivalently encoded more simply in the collection of data given by (non-positively graded) **chain complexes in abelian groups**.


## 定义

拓扑空间 $X$ 上 Abel 群层的上同调 $H^i(X,-)$ 是[[整体截面]] $\Gamma$ 的右[[导出函子]], 也即 $X\to *$ 的[[导出前推]].

空间 $X$ 上的层上同调可视为 $X$ 上的 [[∞-层 ∞-意象]]中的映射同伦类:
$$
H^n(X,F)\simeq \pi_0\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{Sh}(X,\infty \mathsf {Grpd})}(X,B^nF).
$$

具体地, 设有[[内射消解]] $F\to I^\bullet$, 定义 $H^n(X,F) := H^n(\Gamma(X,I^\bullet))$.
